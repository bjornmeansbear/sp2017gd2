Graphic Design 2 Files, Spring 2017

Here are a bunch of code ideas for running through with students for the purposes of demos, projects, etc. Ideas for reading assignments to accompany some of these things can be found in Readings.md

Some things I've worked on in the past:

- slideToggle: <http://codepen.io/bjornmeansbear/pen/WrXoYQ>
- FourCorners: <http://codepen.io/bjornmeansbear/pen/NNyRyJ>
- Record Cover?: <http://codepen.io/bjornmeansbear/pen/GZdbLJ>
- Nested Popup: <http://codepen.io/bjornmeansbear/pen/QNrXov>
- Bricks: <http://codepen.io/bjornmeansbear/pen/eZrgve>
- Menu Pattern: <http://codepen.io/bjornmeansbear/pen/EjbRde>
- Mobile Menu Idea (no more hamburger!): <http://codepen.io/bjornmeansbear/pen/yJwVrv>
- CSS animation: <http://codepen.io/bjornmeansbear/pen/gbveXZ>
- Cool Hover Effect: <http://codepen.io/bjornmeansbear/pen/pgKgdN>
- (and here, w/ Behance content pulled in): <http://codepen.io/bjornmeansbear/pen/xRdXwE>

Variations on a theme:

## Other things that could be "games"

1. positioning

  - play w/ static, absolute, relative and fixed... what are the rules? what are the constraints? what's the point?

2. Backgrounds -- see background-hijinks, but there could be other stuff...

3. Responsive

  - skinny < to > wide
  - something about "goldilocks?"
  - could we use responsiveness to make animations? like really small iterative changes as a screen gets bigger almost frame-by-frame kind of stuff?

4. CSS Transformations - how to play with rotate, skew, etc. in interesting ways? how does this teach us better design skills on top of just learning the CSS?

5. Menus

  - Down with the Hamburger! What are alternatives we can come up w/ for lessening the scale/size/hierarchy of menus for smaller screens?
  - icons replace words > gestalt, semiotics...

6. WireFrames

  - how to see fluid, dynamic digital layouts/grids?
  - how to see modules?
  - how to see systems?
  - again, don't quite know what a "wireframe game" is yet, but a place to start pondering...

7. :Hover

  - there is so much this could do probably...
  - totally change what's there, reveal extra content, think about the ways this affects interactions?

8. Something about grids/layouts

  - grid systems?
  - replicate something?

9. HTML/CSS Poster > not a game as much a small assignment. Maybe after we play around with some typography and CSS transforms then this is a good week or two long assignment for outside of class? think of the browser as a poster medium? is that what a lot of websites are basically like now?
