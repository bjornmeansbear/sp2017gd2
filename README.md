## Other things that could be "games"

1. positioning

  - play w/ static, absolute, relative and fixed... what are the rules? what are the constraints? what's the point?

2. Backgrounds -- see background-hijinks, but there could be other stuff...
3. Responsive

  - skinny < to > wide
  - something about "goldilocks?"
  - could we use responsiveness to make animations? like really small iterative changes as a screen gets bigger almost frame-by-frame kind of stuff?

4. CSS Transformations - how to play with rotate, skew, etc. in interesting ways? how does this teach us better design skills on top of just learning the CSS?
5. Menus

  - Down with the Hamburger! What are alternatives we can come up w/ for lessening the scale/size/hierarchy of menus for smaller screens?
  - icons replace words > gestalt, semiotics...

6. WireFrames

  - how to see fluid, dynamic digital layouts/grids?
  - how to see modules?
  - how to see systems?
  - again, don't quite know what a "wireframe game" is yet, but a place to start pondering...
