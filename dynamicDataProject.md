# Hacking the Behance API

## (design + build yourself a portfolio website)

For this project we will be taking a data feed from an API and use templates to dynamically build a website. The project is centered around designing a portfolio site for yourself. We will use Behance as a content management system (when you add a project on Behance, it will be added to your personal website), grab posts from their data feed, experiment w/ using javascript for dynamic templating in the browser, and then find interesting ways of styling a template.

1 sentence: Find an API and template some data.<br>
`data = content, html = template, css = style`

We will focus on the Behance API for our class demos as it is a nice way to start work on a portfolio website. However, you can apply what we'll accomplish to any JSON feed.

### Other aspects of the project:

- Sketching.
- Wireframing.
- Planning.
- Multiple Designs.
- Learning more about Javascript/jQuery
- Learning more about dynamic data
- Thinking about systems
- Designing is really designing the template and rules for styling; this is applicable to everything you design.

### Deliverables:

- HTML/CSS/JS website (to be turned in by 7pm Sunday April 30th so we can have everyone's sites loaded and ready for the start of class)
- Utilize Behance-Kit code
- Integrate media queries / make your site mobile friendly.
- Documentation of your process

  - sketches/wireframes
  - examples of portfolios you found interesting
  - 3 alternate templates/stylings for how your feed and a single "post" could look

### Criteria Point breakdown (20 points possible):

- 2pts: Utilizes behance-kit code (or custom implementation of this for data feed of your choosing)
